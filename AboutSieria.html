    <p class="AboutParagraph">Hello welcome to my portfolio! I grew up in Carterville IL and moved to Tennessee
        when I was 14. I graduated when I was 16 to pursue an early career. 
        I went to Volunteer Community College and received a degree in Respiratory therapy.
        I have been a Respiratory therapist for 4 years and want a different specialty under my belt. 
        I have always had a passion for computers. I constantly am IT support for my family.
        As soon as I started CodexAcademy I knew this is what I want to be doing. It has been 
        challenging being a full time mom,
        having a full time job, and going to school. I know in the end it will all be worth it 
        and I am excited to continue with this 
        path.
